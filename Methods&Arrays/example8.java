//here we're calling an array just by method passing array elements just from a method
//we have declared user defined method then use for loop for This loop goes through each number in the array and prints it.

//int num : numbers â†’ This means "for each number (num) in the array (numbers), print it."
//then we use display(marks) in public static void main for Here, we send the whole array to the printArray method.

// The method receives it as int[] numbers and prints all the values.
